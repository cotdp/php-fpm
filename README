This repository contains a hacked spec file for php, to use it do the following.

1. Install php source "yumdownloader --source php" which should get you the latest,

2. "rpm -i php-5.3.6-1.fc14.src.rpm" to install the source into $HOME/rpmbuild,

3. Replace the file $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/php.spec with the php.spec from here,

4. "cd rpmbuild" and run the builder "rpmbuild -ba SPECS/php.spec",

The resulting "php-cli" package will now include the php-fpm stuff, its man pages, init script and conf template.
